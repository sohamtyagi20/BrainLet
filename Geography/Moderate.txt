In a hurricane, the lowest surface pressures can be found in this area. The rest of the storm rotates around this point and on land, it is the calmest part of the storm with clear clouds and sun. #Eye, Rainbands, Eyewall, Outflow
This scale measures earthquake intensity by determining the amount of energy released. It is logarithmic and each point is a tenfold increase in magnitude. #Richter, Mercalli, Fujita-Pearson, Saffir-Simpson
Magma is composed of various elements. Which of the following is not present in magma? #Beryllium, Aluminum, Sodium, Oxygen
When volcanoes erupt, they eject small rock fragments into the atmosphere. Often, these pieces are large, which destroys communication lines and buries roads. What are these rock fragments called? #Tephra, Felsic, Ash, Magma
This atmospheric layer contains 75% of the atmosphereâ€™s mass. Due to gravity, it has the greatest air pressure and all weather occurs in this layer. #Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Exosphere
The formation of a tornado relies on several factors, including strong convection currents. The main area is formed by convection currents which fills the sky with moisture and energy. What part of a tornado is being formed? #Funnel, Eyewall, Magma, Epicenter
After a volcanic eruption, heavy rains and melting snow can mix with volcanic ash and rocks. This creates massive mudflows that travel 80km. What are these mudflows called? #Lahars, Lava, Batholiths, Magma
