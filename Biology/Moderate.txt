In a plant cell, these cells transport water and dissolved minerals up from the roots. They are hollow tubes with strong, rigid walls and no organelles. #Xylem, Phloem, Tracheids, Dicots
Plants are complex structures. These tissues are the filler between the dermal and vascular tissues. Their primary function is to photosynthesize in the green parts. #Ground, Pith, Monocot, Vascular
This individual is considered the creator of modern-day genetics. By using pea plants, inheritance patterns were traced and alleles were discovered. #Mendel, Darwin, Aristotle, Watson
When meiosis I occurs, the cytoplasm is not equally divided between the two daughter cells. This cell receives the most cytoplasm, unlike the polar body. #Primary oocyte, Oogonium, Zygotes, Gametes
This type of mutation is when a part of one chromosome attaches to another part of the same chromosome. Leukemia can be caused as a result. #Translocation, Deletion, Substitution, Inversion
There can be several potential errors during meiosis. This type of error occurs when the homologous chromosomes do not separate during anaphase I or II. #Nondisjunction, Duplication, Frameshift, Disjunction
This term refers to cell fragments that are responsible for initiating the clotting process. It is one of the crucial components in blood. #Platelets, Plasma, Erythrocytes, White blood cells
